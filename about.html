            <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
            <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise
                routine.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Burpee</dt>
                <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing
                    position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward
                    again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>

                <dt>Plank</dt>
                <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your
                    forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>

                <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position,
                    bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a
                    mountain).</dd>
