    <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> chen meng hua</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        Build a small website for <em>100SMILES Dental Care</em> that measurably increases new-patient enquiries and
        bookings from local families (children’s first visits) and retirees in Razole, Queensland. Specifically, within
        the first 4 weeks after launch, achieve: (1) ≥20% more email booking enquiries leveraging the “20% first visit”
        promotion; (2) ≥30 unique phone tap-to-call clicks per week during trading hours; and (3) ≥40 reads of at least
        one educational article per week to support preventive-care awareness. These goals align to the clinic’s “all
        ages” positioning, long-standing local presence (33 Fantail Street, Razole), broad service range (check-ups,
        cleanings, implants, orthodontics, cosmetic), and current promotions.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>

    <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

            the “20% first visit”
            promo; target ≥20% increase vs. baseline. (Promo stated by client.):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phone enquiries:</strong> measure tap-to-call (<code>tel:</code>) clicks; target ≥30 per week,
            concentrated within

            reads/week.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
